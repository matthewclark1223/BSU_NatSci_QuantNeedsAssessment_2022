I know Matt and I think he is a great mentor, but I am not sure all students have had a chance to meet with him and feel comfortable. ","Maybe more in person discussion or a seminar dedicated to ""cool"" R or Phyton tools. Something where students get inspired by other people's work, but also presenters must be encourage to present things in super simple words. I often feel some profesors forget we don't always know what package or program they are talking about and feels dawnting to even ask questions. It feels like we should know this by now. I am happy to see more diverse range of professors like Allison and Jen offering classes. I feel they make stats more inclusive. "
